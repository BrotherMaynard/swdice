# Star Wars Dice Roller

> "Make a formidable Lore check, with one setback for every kilometer between you and the Jedi Archives on Coruscant."

There are not enough dice in the Galaxy to even roll this check, so clearly, we need a software solution. Being interested in both Spring and React, I decided to implement a simple dice roller app using an enterprise backend and thin React client. This is as much a learning experience and practice application as a practical solution.
