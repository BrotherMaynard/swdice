# Star Wars Dice Roller

> "Make a formidable Lore check, with one setback for every kilometer between you and the Jedi Archives on Coruscant."

There are not enough dice in the Galaxy to even roll this check, so clearly, we need a software solution. Being interested in both Spring and React, I decided to implement a simple dice roller app using an enterprise backend and thin React client. This is as much a learning experience and practice application as a practical solution.

## Building and Running

You will need the following software:

1. Git
2. Java 8+
3. Maven
4. Node + NPM

### Backend

The backend is based on Spring Boot and uses Maven.

	./mvnw spring-boot:run

### Frontend

The frontend is based on Create React App and uses `npm`.

	npm start
